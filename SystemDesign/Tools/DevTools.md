ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are special HTML attributes that add semantic meaning and context to web elements, making dynamic content (like sliders, tabs, modals) understandable and usable for people with disabilities using assistive technologies (ATs) like screen readers, bridging gaps where standard HTML isn't enough

Use semantic HTML first: Always prefer native HTML elements (like <button>, <nav>) when possible, as they have built-in ARIA roles.
Use sparingly: Only add ARIA when semantic HTML isn't sufficient for accessibility.

aria-label: Provides a text label for an element (e.g., `<button aria-label="Close">X</button>`).
aria-expanded: Indicates if a collapsible section is open or closed (e.g., `aria-expanded="true"` or `"false"`).
