An **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** *packet* is generated in various scenarios to report network conditions or errors. Here are common cases:

1. **Ping Requests/Replies** â€“ When using the `ping` command, ICMP Echo Request (Type 8) and Echo Reply (Type 0) packets are exchanged.
   ```bash
   rudraksh @ðŸ”¥:~$ping google.com -c 2
   PING google.com (2404:6800:4002:802::200e) 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from del03s01-in-x0e.1e100.net (2404:6800:4002:802::200e): icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=49.1 ms
   64 bytes from del03s01-in-x0e.1e100.net (2404:6800:4002:802::200e): icmp_seq=2 ttl=118 time=48.2 ms

   --- google.com ping statistics ---
   2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1002ms
   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 48.168/48.648/49.129/0.480 ms
   ```
2. **Destination Unreachable** â€“ If a router or host cannot deliver a packet, it sends an ICMP **Destination Unreachable (Type 3)** message.
3. **Time Exceeded** â€“ When a packetâ€™s TTL (Time to Live, gets decremented by 1 at each hop) reaches zero, a **Time Exceeded (Type 11)** message is sent (used in `traceroute`).

   ```bash
   rudraksh @ðŸ”¥:~$mtr google.com #mytraceroute

   ```

4. **Redirect Message** â€“ A router may send an ICMP **Redirect (Type 5)** to suggest a better route.
5. **Fragmentation Needed** â€“ If a packet requires fragmentation but the DF (Donâ€™t Fragment) flag is set, an ICMP **Fragmentation Needed (Type 3, Code 4)** message is sent.

ICMP helps diagnose and manage IP communication but does not carry application data. Some ICMP messages may be blocked by firewalls for security.

### How will a router knows that the packet it sent got lost in void?

A router **typically doesnâ€™t know** if a forwarded packet is lost(so no ICMP packet is generated) unless:
1. An ICMP error is returned (rare for random drops).
2. A routing protocol notifies it of a link failure. (Long-Term Detection)
3. External tools (like `ping`, `traceroute`) are used to probe the path.

Some other cases when an **ICMP packet is not generated** to prevent network congestion, security risks, or protocol misuse:  

- **1. For Another ICMP Error Message**  
   If an ICMP packet (e.g., "Destination Unreachable") itself fails, **no ICMP error is sent** to avoid infinite loops. Suppose the TTL of ICMP packet itsefl has reached 0 and the router decides to drop it, then it will not send another ICMP packet to source.

-  **2. For Non-Initial IP Fragments**  
   If a fragmented IP packet (not the first fragment) is dropped, **no ICMP error is sent**.  

-  **3. For Broadcast/Multicast Traffic**  
   ICMP errors are **not sent** in response to broadcast or multicast packets (to prevent flooding).  

-  **4. For Packets with Invalid Source IPs**  
   If the source IP is **zero (0.0.0.0)**, **loopback (127.x.x.x)**, or a **non-routable address**, ICMP errors are **not generated**.  

-  **5. For Certain Security/Drop Policies**  
   - Firewalls/routers may **silently drop** packets (without ICMP errors) due to:  
     - **Rate-limiting** (to prevent ICMP flooding).  
     - **Administrative filtering** (e.g., DDoS protection).  
     - **Privacy/Security** (e.g., "stealth" mode to avoid network scanning).  

-  **6. For Some Link-Layer Errors**  
   If a packet is dropped at **Layer 2 (e.g., Ethernet/Wi-Fi)**, no ICMP message is sent (ICMP operates at **Layer 3**).  



## **ICMP in IPv6 (ICMPv6)**
- **RFC**: 4443 (replaces ICMP for IPv6).
- **New Features**:
  - **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** (replaces ARP).
  - **Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)**.
  - **Router Solicitation/Advertisement**.
- **Key Differences**:
  - New message types (e.g., **Router Solicitation (133)**, **Neighbor Advertisement (136)**).
  - No more "Source Quench" (replaced by better congestion control mechanisms).
