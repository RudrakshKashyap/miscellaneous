## My understanding
Just generate seperate tokens for each session, but if you want to differentiate devices you need to device fingerprint.

### Different Pair for Each Device

In a standard, modern implementation, each login session is treated as a unique entity. When you log in on Device A, the server generates a specific token pair for that session. If you then log in on Device B, the server generates a completely separate pair.

| Device | Access Token | Refresh Token | Session Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phone** | `AT_Alpha` | `RT_Alpha` | Session 1 |
| **Laptop** | `AT_Beta` | `RT_Beta` | Session 2 |

* **Security (Blast Radius):** If your phone is stolen and an attacker gets the refresh token, the server can revoke *only* the phone’s token. Your laptop remains logged in and safe.
* **Independent Expiry:** You might use your phone every day but only use your laptop once a week. Separate tokens allow the phone to stay "refreshed" while the laptop session might eventually expire due to inactivity.

# FingerPrinting

Device fingerprinting is a sophisticated tracking technique that identifies a unique user or device by combining various hardware and software attributes. Unlike cookies, which are files stored on your machine that you can delete, a fingerprint is "stateless"—it’s a digital signature generated based on how your device is built and configured.

## 1.[ Browser Fingerprinting](https://browserleaks.com/)

In a browser, websites use JavaScript and HTTP headers to gather data. Because web browsers are designed to be "helpful" to servers (to ensure sites render correctly), they broadcast a significant amount of information.

### Core Identifiers

| Identifier | What it reveals |
| --- | --- |
| **User-Agent String** | Browser name, version, and the host Operating System (e.g., Chrome 120 on macOS). (You can edit it in **Network condition** tab of devtools)|
| **HTTP Headers** | Language preferences, encoding support, and "Do Not Track" settings. |
| **Screen Resolution** | Your monitor's width, height, color depth, and the actual available "workspace" (excluding taskbars). |
| **Timezone & Locale** | Your system clock offset and regional settings (e.g., `en-US`, `Asia/Kolkata`). |
| **Installed Fonts** | A list of every font installed on your system. This is highly unique because users often install specific software (like Adobe or CAD) that adds unique fonts. A script tells the browser to try and render a text using a specific rare font and a generic fallback font. The script measures the **width and height** of the generated text down to the pixel. |

### Advanced Techniques

* **Canvas Fingerprinting:** The website asks your browser to draw a hidden image or text. Because of tiny differences in graphics drivers, GPU hardware, and font smoothing (anti-aliasing), every device renders the image slightly differently at the pixel level.
* **WebGL Fingerprinting:** Similar to Canvas, but it forces the GPU to render 3D shapes. It reveals the exact model of your graphics card and driver version.
* **Audio Fingerprinting:** The site uses the Web Audio API to process a sound wave. The "noise" and frequency response generated by your sound card create a unique signature.
* **Media Device Enumeration:** A list of connected hardware like microphones, cameras, and speakers (even without accessing them, the browser can see their IDs).

## 2. App & Software Fingerprinting

Mobile apps and desktop software have deeper access to your hardware than a browser does. They don't just "guess" your identity; they can often read it directly.

### Hardware-Level Identifiers

* **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity):** A unique 15-digit code for every cellular device. Only devices with a SIM slot have an IMEI. Visible to cellular towers and the mobile network provider. Identifies the phone itself to the carrier.
* **Serial Number:** The manufacturer-assigned serial number for the motherboard or device.
* **MAC Address:** The physical address of your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth chip.

### Software-Level Identifiers

* **Advertising ID (IDFA/AAID):** A "resettable" ID provided by Apple (IDFA) or Google (AAID) specifically for advertisers.
* **Vendor ID (IDFV):** An ID unique to a specific app developer. If you have three apps by the same company, they will all see the same IDFV, but a different company's app will see a different one.
* **Android ID:** A 64-bit number generated on the first boot of a device.

### Environmental Data

* **Battery Status:** Your current charge level and whether you are plugged in (surprisingly effective for short-term tracking).
* **Storage/RAM:** The exact total capacity and currently available space.
* **Installed App List:** A list of other apps you have installed (more common on older Android versions).

---
* **Browser Fingerprinting** = High-level, based on software settings and rendering quirks.
* **App Fingerprinting** = Low-level, based on direct hardware IDs and OS-level data.
* **Uniqueness:** A single attribute (like screen resolution) isn't unique, but the *combination* of 30+ attributes makes your device "1 in a billion."
